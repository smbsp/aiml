# AIML Project Repository

This repository documents my personal and structured exploration of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I am tackling core topics and challenges in AIML through hands-on problem-solving, research, and experimentation. Each module is designed to deepen understanding and reflect real-world applications ‚Äî from data analytics and modeling to system design and deployment.

## üß≠ Purpose

- Explore AI/ML concepts in a self-directed, project-based manner
- Solve meaningful problems using statistical reasoning and machine learning techniques
- Build a modular body of work that evolves through iteration and practical application
- Maintain transparency and consistency via daily/weekly commits
